                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            More and more people have been learning about cryptocurrency. The amount of cryptocurrency users has grown exponentially over the last ten years <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/">Statista Link</a>. Most people introduced to cryptocurrency, have heard about Bitcoin. It is the number one cryptocurrency after all. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As of writing this article, Bitcoin’s market cap is over a trillion USD. Bitcoin is a very useful asset and store of value. Unfortunately, it has some critical flaws built into the protocol. In this article I will compare Bitcoin to another cryptocurrency called “Nano”. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nano has the exact same goals as Bitcoin. They both aim to be a peer-to-peer digital currency and a transfer/store of value. Although the goal is the same, these currencies have very different approaches to solving the issues. Lets first discuss what these currencies have in common, then we will discuss all the differences.

                        <h3>Similarities</h3>
                        <p>
                            Bitcoin and Nano are very barebone protocols. In other cryptocurrency projects a lot of the networks implement things. Other networks allow for things like tokenization, smart contracts, and on-chain development. Bitcoin and Nano do not allow for any of these services. This is because they are simply a peer-to-peer transfer of value. Nothing more, nothing less. This is about where the similarities end between the two networks.

                        <h3>Consensus Method (PoW vs DPoS)</h3>
                        <p>
                            The two cryptocurrencies use different consensus methods. Bitcoin utilizes Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoW means that miners are used to the secure the network. The simplest way of explaining mining is that the Bitcoin miners have large computers attempting to solve a very complex puzzle. This can be done solo or in a pool with other users to combine their computer power for a better chance at solving the puzzle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The miner (or mining pool) that completes that puzzle first, wins the block. Winning the block means that you get both the transaction fees paid for that block plus the block reward. The block reward started at 50 Bitcoin per block at its conception, and it gets cut in half every four years. This process is known as the “halving” and has happened three times since Bitcoin’s creation. The current block reward is 6.25 Bitcoin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This method of consensus has been proven to be well secured. The more users that adopt the network, the more you have people mining the network, the less chance you have of a bad actor attacking the network. The problem with this method is that it uses a lot of resources. We will talk later about how much energy Bitcoin really uses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nano uses Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). DPoS is a fork of the standard Proof-of-State concept. The only difference between the two are that in standard PoS, each user votes with the weight of the amount of coins they hold. DPoS does not let individuals vote, they delegate their voting weight to a larger party to vote on their behalf. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nano allows up to 1000 principle representatives. To become a principle representative, you require at least 0.1% of all the voting weight. Currently there are 117 principle representatives <a target="_blank" href="https://nanocharts.info/">Nano Charts Link</a>. This number is constantly changing as new representatives become available and as user change their delegated weight to different representatives.
