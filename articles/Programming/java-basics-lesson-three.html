                            Now that we have covered the basics of variables, we can move onto if statements. So, what is an if statement? An if statement is a block of code that says, “If this condition is met, do something”. You are then to input a single or multiple conditions
                            that need to be met.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="codeDiv">
                        <img class="image code" src="../../images/Code/ageCheck.png">
                        <p>
                            This can be viewed in a very basic sense or in a very complex sense depending on the conditions. A simple example would be the code above. The code above runs a conditional to see the the variable "age" is 18 or greater. If it is, like in this case, the
                            block surrounded by the brackets <code>{ }</code> will be executed. In this case it will just run a print statement telling us that we are indeed an adult. If we are not an adult, the program will
                            not print anything.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <p>
                            This is an example of an if/else statement. In the first example, we had a program that would print out that you are an adult if you are 18 or older. It did't do anything if you were younger than 18 though. In this example, if you are not 18 or older,
                            it was automatically run the <code>else</code> block and print out that you are a child.
                        </p>

                            This is an example of an if/elseif/else statement. We have covered how blocks work in an if statement would if the returns true, it'll execute that block, otherwise it'll execute the else block. Now we see in this example, an <code>else if</code>                            block. So what does an else if block do? If the first if statement returns false, it will look at the else if and see if that returns true or false now. If it returns true, it'll execute that block and exit the if statements.
                            If it returns false it will continue progressing through the else if blocks to see if any of them are true. If none are true, it'll execute the else statement if there is one.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In this final example of if/elseif/else statements, we will look at a piece of code that will look at your percentage grade and return a letter grade. As you can see, we have the checks lining up in descending order so it will first check for the highest
                            letter grade and work towards the lowest letter grade. This program will compare the student's grade to the 'A' category. the students grade is lower than 80, so the program moves into the first else if. The program then compares
                            the students' grade to the 'B' category. The student's grade is lower than 70, so it moves onto the next else if. Then the program compares the student's grade to the 'C' category. Finally the student's grade is higher than
                            the base of the 'C' category. The program prints out the 'C' grade and exits the if statements.

                    <div class="codeDiv">
                        <img class="image code medium" src="../../images/Code/multipleConditionals.png">
                        <p>
                            In this example, we are putting multiple seperate conditions inside of a single if statement. This code is saying that you must both be 18 or older, plus you must be a student for this print statement to run. There are two keys in multiple conditioned
                            if statements. There is the "And" operator, shown here as <code>&&</code>. This means both statements must be true for the if block to execute. There is also the "Or" operator, shown here as <code>||</code>.
                            This means either statement has to be true for it to execute. The Or statement does not require both to be true.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The "Equals" operator <code>==</code> inside the if statement is not setting any value like the <code>=</code> sign normally does. This double equals sign is checking to see if these values are equal. So in this case the program
                            is checking the <code>isStudent</code> variable to see if it equals true. If the program was to check if they are not a student, it would use the "Not Equals" operator, which look like this <code>!=</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a side note about the <code>isStudent == true</code> check. This can be simplified to just <code>isStudent</code>. This is because any boolean has to be either true or false. If you put this alone in an if statement, it
                            will check if the boolean is true and execute, or if it is false it can just skip. If we were looking for it to be false, we could put a "Not" operator <code>!</code> infront to check. It would look like this inside the if
                            statement
                            <code>!isStudent</code>.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                            This next concept is called "Nested Ifs". This is when you have if statements inside other if statements. In this example, I have a set of outer if/else statements and a set of inner if/else statements.
